# Ansible #

This repo contains ansible configuration used available to all projects.  It does not contain any information related to specific projects.

To use ansible for managing and deploying any particular project, you should create a `{project_name}-ansible` repository.  In that repository you
should add this as a submodule in the `common/` directory.
